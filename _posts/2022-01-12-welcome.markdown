Well, now my blog is online for more than one month and I still haven't written a
single post. Why is that? Maybe I am clinging to the idea of being original and
to write a perfectly interesting article about a trending topic. But I am
probably just looking for a noble excuse to procrastinate. So this why I start
with exactly that question.

How do I start a blog?

Here I am quoting Shia LaBeouf and actually having fun writing this. Maybe
writing is not so hard after all and I have to admit that there is some truth to
Shia's statement.

So maybe it is that easy. Here it is, the start of my blog. Welcome strangers!

Let's see where this will go in the future!
